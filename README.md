## League Clone Project
This is a fun web app built based on the game League of Legends. It is used to look up the data about each champion.
Inside this project, I have used:
+ React to build the website and handle the routing
+ Redux for a better state management
+ Semantic UI and CSS for styling and hanlding responsiveness
+ and lastly Riot API to receive the data about the game

## Hosted Website 
The hosted version of this project can be found here: 

https://leagueclone.herokuapp.com/

## Instruction
If you want to run this locally, please follow these steps (assuming NodeJs is installed):
+ npm install
+ npm start

And the window for this web app should pop up automatically on your browser at localhost:3000.
